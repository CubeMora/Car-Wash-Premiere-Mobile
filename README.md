## GitHub Justification

The integration of GitHub and Git into the development workflow of the Car Wash Premiere Mobile app justifies itself through efficient collaboration, streamlined bug fixing, and maintenance. GitHub provides a centralized repository for seamless code sharing and structured development, while Git's version control capabilities allow for concurrent work on branches.

### Branches

The app utilizes three branches: "dev" for ongoing development, "feature" for testing new features that may undergo further development, and "main" as the stable production version of the app. This branching strategy ensures a controlled development process, allowing developers to work on new features without disrupting the stability of the main version. By leveraging these tools and branches, Car Wash Premiere Mobile establishes a robust workflow that enhances collaboration, version control, and overall app stability, reliability, and scalability.

## Asana

As much as the actual code of the project matters and is important to keep it under control, it’ll all crumble without proper team management and extends to the maintenance of our application. Managing the different aspects of this project—ranging from UI/UX design changes, frontend and backend functionality tweaks, to database element modifications—requires a structured and efficient approach. This is where Asana, a project management tool, comes in.

1. **Collaboration:** With a team of five members, each with different roles, collaboration is critical. Asana allows users to assign tasks to team members, making it clear who is responsible for what. Furthermore, team members can comment on tasks, facilitating clear and concise communication.
2. **Organization: A**ll the project's information is stored in one place, accessible to everyone on the team. This prevents confusion or loss of important data. Asana's ability to create different project boards for various tasks also allows for easy tracking of the progress in different areas—design, functionalities, database elements, etc.
3. **Task Management:** Asana's task management feature allows tasks to be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks with their own deadlines and people in charge. This makes it easy to keep track of what needs to be done and when, ensuring that the project stays on schedule.
4. **Timeline View:** The timeline feature provides a visual representation of the project schedule, showing how all the tasks fit together over time. This is particularly useful for ensuring that the various parts of the project are well-coordinated and that any dependencies are clearly visible.
5. **Integration:** Asana offers a wide range of integration possibilities with other tools, such as Slack for communication or Google Drive for document storage. This can greatly improve workflow and efficiency.
6. **Notifications and Reminders:** Asana can send notifications and reminders about upcoming deadlines or tasks that need attention. This can help keep everyone on the team on track and ensure that nothing is overlooked.

## Conclusions

### Marco Trejo

Software maintenance is an aspect of the career we’re going to face constantly throughout the entirety of it, and this project gives us the chance to try different things in regard to management, task assignment, and version control. I’ve used GitHub in the past, though in very limited ways, so experimenting a bit more with it, hopefully without messing anything up in the process, seems like a sound idea. Management this time around is going to be handled with a platform I’ve never even heard of, so it’ll be an opportunity to see how different it is from the ones I’ve had the chance to use in the past, although it looks like a solid option at first glance.

In my roles, and as far as the UI/UX design goes, I think most of the documentation for it will go on Asana and towards the team manager, while the actual front end will be stored in GitHub, creating a neat distinction between both.

### Fily Ortega

As a conclusion, during this project of software maintenance, we’re going to be using a couple of tools outside the ones used at the beginning of the development of the project, Anada and GitHub. Asana is the compass guiding our team. With diverse tasks at hand and a team working on various aspects of the application, Asana provides us the clarity we need. It helps us outline tasks, delegate them, and monitor progress, all while facilitating efficient communication among us. It is this clarity and synergy that will allow us to navigate the project effectively and efficiently.

In addition to this, GitHub serves as our technical storage or emergency backup and as a way to add changes at any time for all members of the team. With a version control system that allows safe experimentation and iterative improvement, it ensures our “codebase” (to call it someway) remains robust. But more than that, GitHub is a platform for us to collaboratively identify, track, and resolve issues, promoting a culture of shared learning and high-quality coding standards. As a team member, I'm eager to leverage these tools to bolster our project and elevate our application.

The role that was assigned to me to work on throughout this process was Frontend dev with my own branch in GitHub. Although I can’t be call a mobile developer per se, based on my previous experiences working as a front, I think I can be a great value addition for the team. I’m familiar with some mobile development theory despite not haven’t apply it first hand yet, but learning new things is always a good thing, so I’m excited to begin working ASAP. 

### Daniel Robles

Closing the current topic is important to say, maintenance is not only adding or removing random stuff just to pretend we are working but actually preventing, updating and re-shaping the whole software even.
Using GitHub we can have better control over who did what and all versions of a project in one place for all, and finally using a dashboard will allow us to organize times and schedule tasks in order to progress, and also the person who's going to be in charge of determined tasks or piece.
